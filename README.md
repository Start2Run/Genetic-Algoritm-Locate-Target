Title:  Genetic Pathfinder (or similar catchy name)
Short Description:
Visualize the power of genetic algorithms! This WPF application demonstrates how a population of virtual "creatures" evolves to find the optimal path from a starting point to a target. Watch as generations learn and adapt to navigate obstacles and discover the shortest route.
Detailed Description:
Genetic Pathfinder is an interactive application that provides a captivating visualization of genetic algorithms in action.  Users can:
 * Set the environment: Define the starting point, target location, and obstacles within a 2D space.
 * Observe the evolution: Watch as a population of virtual entities, each with a unique "genetic code" representing a path, attempts to reach the target.
 * Track progress:  See how the population improves over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation. The fittest individuals, those closest to the target, are more likely to reproduce and pass on their traits.
 * Analyze the results:  Visualize the best path found by the algorithm and analyze its performance metrics.
 * Experiment with parameters: Adjust parameters like population size, mutation rate, and selection criteria to understand their impact on the algorithm's effectiveness.
Key Features:
 * Interactive UI:  An intuitive interface allows users to easily set up simulations and visualize results.
 * Real-time visualization:  Observe the evolution process unfold dynamically.
 * Customizable environment: Design different scenarios with varying obstacles and target locations.
 * Educational tool:  Gain a deeper understanding of genetic algorithms and their applications.
Target Audience:
 * Students learning about artificial intelligence and optimization algorithms.
 * Developers interested in exploring genetic algorithms for problem-solving.
 * Anyone curious about the fascinating world of evolutionary computation.
